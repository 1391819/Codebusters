## Overview of Technologies Used

Our objective for this project was to create a fully functioning application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all modules we covered during our training .We have created a full-stack web application for QA Cinemas that fully conforms to a provided client specification. The website was made with ease of use and attractiveness in mind, and provides information about movies, listings, upcoming releases and the ability to log in and book tickets.

We have used the following technologies in our project:

- Jira for project management via Kanban
- Scrum as the agile methodology
- Git as the version control system
- GitHub for source code management
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for front-end development
- Python as the back-end programming language
- Flask as the API development platform
- MySQL as the database management system
- Pytest and Flask-testing for performings tests
- Jenkins for continuous integration
- Docker for containerisation
